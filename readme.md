## The kata: FizzBuzz

Write a function that takes a *positive* integer N as an argument, and then returns the number.
However:
- for multiples of 3 (i.e. the number is divisible by 3), return "Fizz" instead of the number 
- for multiples of 5 (i.e. the number is divisible by 5), return "Buzz" instead of the number 
- for multiples of both 3 and 5 (i.e. the number is divisible by both 3 and 5), return "FizzBuzz" instead of the number
